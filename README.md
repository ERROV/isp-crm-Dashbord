# Hala FTTH - ISP CRM & Help Desk System

This is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to serve as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Help Desk system for an Internet Service Provider (ISP). It provides a multi-faceted platform for managing subscribers, tickets, tasks, employees, and sales leads, all governed by a robust role-based access control system.

The application is built with a modern technology stack, featuring Next.js for the frontend and backend, NextAuth.js for authentication, and is designed to work with MongoDB for data persistence, while also supporting a mock data mode for easy demonstration.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - Secure user login and session management using NextAuth.js.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to features based on user roles (e.g., Super Admin, Support Manager, Reseller, Client).
  - A demo-friendly login page to easily switch between different user roles without needing passwords.

- **Role-Specific Dashboards:**
  - Dynamic dashboards that present relevant information and modules based on the logged-in user's permissions.
  - At-a-glance cards for key metrics like open tickets and pending tasks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or later recommended)
- `npm` or `yarn` package manager

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/isp-crm.git
    cd isp-crm
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add the following variables.

    ```env
    # A long, random string used to hash tokens and sign cookies
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here

    # Your MongoDB connection string (optional, as the app uses mock data by default)
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

    # Your Google Gemini API Key for the AI Summary feature (optional)
    API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```

    - **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`**: This is required by NextAuth.js. You can generate a secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`.
    - **`MONGODB_URI`**: The application is configured to use mock data, so this is not strictly necessary for the demo to run. If you wish to connect to a real database, you'll need to provide your connection string.
    - **`API_KEY`**: This is needed for the "AI Summary" feature on the tickets page. If left blank, the feature will be gracefully disabled.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### üé≠ Demo Mode

By default, the application runs in a "demo mode" that uses mock data defined in `/lib/mockData.ts`. This allows you to explore the full functionality of the application without needing to set up a database.

The login page (`/auth/login`) features a dropdown menu that lets you sign in as any of the predefined users, making it easy to test the different roles and permissions.
